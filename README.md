The adults have died out, leaving just the children behind. Japan is shrouded in deep forest. Strange, misshapen beasts prowl around as though the land now belongs to them. But, among all this, the children have chosen to live, to survive on their own. Our story begins 5 years after the fall of human society.  This is a game in which players take on the role of those who remained after the destruction of human culture in Japan. The player characters (PCs) brave the dangers of the deep woods in search of supplies they will need to continue their survival.
